# Voice-Prescription
A very good inoovative gui application that prepares prescription by both doctor patient telephone communication and also by doctor.

With the increasing number of patients, it is very difficult for the doctors to write prescriptions manually and have an account of all the patients. The proposed system will provide a platform for the doctors to dictate their prescription orally instead of typing or writing it manually which saves a lot of time for doctors as well as the patients and avoids human errors to a greater extent .The proposed system converts the voice to text first and then generate prescriptions automatically by extracting the keywords and provides the prescription in the desired format automatically. This system can also generate prescriptions efficiently with just the audio fileof the conversation between the doctor and the patient through a phone call. The patient need not visit the doctor manually for curing very small health issues. It also provides a way to send the prescription through mail personally to the patient so that they need not meet the doctor again for prescription. This system also provides an option for the doctor to sign the prescription after reviewing it. Since the prescription provided is verified by the doctor there is no possibility of mistakes in this system and the security of the patients medical records is maintained.
